# Context: Try‑On Mobile App with Nano Banana (Gemini)

Context document generated from **Bianca Fuhrmann (2).xlsx** on **2025-11-16 04:59 IST**.

This document translates spreadsheet inputs into a concrete plan for a **React Native** mobile application that lets users **upload a selfie** and **try on garments from product URLs**, powered by a **cloud image-editing API (“Nano Banana” / Gemini Image)”** behind your backend. It is designed to be immediately useful for engineering kick-off, scoping, and stakeholder alignment.


# Goals & Scope

**Primary Goal**

Enable a user to upload a selfie, paste one or more product URLs (PDP links or direct image links), and receive fast, realistic **try‑on previews** inside the mobile app.

**Non‑Goals (Phase‑1)**

- Production‑grade photoreal e‑commerce rendering for every edge case
- Full offline image generation on device
- Marketplace integrations beyond reading public product media


# What the Spreadsheet Tells Us (Auto‑Parsed)

**Candidate Features (from spreadsheet):**
- View and try on an item from shopping site in the becauseFUTURE app/extension
- Fitting
- Avatar Creation
- Garment recommendations
- Extract / Scrape sizing data
- Save User Garment Uploads basic
- Registration: User body measurements
- Avatar Styling: Basic
- Save and reopen finds.
- Registration: Basic information
- Sign-in
- AI Model Fine-tuning
- Dev Status Prior to Dev Team Hire
- Satisfactory
- Update Required
- Major Changes Required
- Not Started
- When I am on a shopping site I want to be able to see this item on myself and get sizing information from becauseFUTURE.
- I want to know if this garment would fit me and if so what size
- I want to create my realistic digital twin. It should look like me and have my body proportions.
- I want to see similar garments as recommendations from the same online shopping site and be able to try them on
- I want to know if a garment will fit me through becauseFUTURES sizing comparison model.
- I take a picture of an item by placing it on bed/sofa/lighter background or on the hanger or on the floor and it gets added to my digital wardrobe. It shall be added to the right category of similar items (long trousers, short trousers, skits, leggins, top, shits, jackets...)
- I want the app to know my body measurements for later purpose so I can use them when I shop something.
- I want to see how an item looks on me and how it looks together with other items and styles.
- I want to save garments that I like so that I can come back to them.
- I want to register with becauseFUTURE and save my information provided so that it shows next time.
- I want to use the information that I have shared with the app when signing in and using it.

# Architecture & Flow

## System Architecture (High Level)

- **Mobile App (React Native)**  
  - Screens: **Selfie Upload**, **Add Item URLs**, **Preview & Compare**, **History**  
  - Image capture from camera or gallery, client-side resize (e.g., 2048px max dimension)

- **Backend API (FastAPI/Node)**  
  - Endpoint: `POST /tryon` → payload: `selfie` (multipart) + `item_urls[]`  
  - Endpoint: `GET /job/{id}` → poll for status/result  
  - Fetches product images **server-side** from URLs → normalizes size → optional segmentation/pose estimation  
  - Calls **Nano Banana / Gemini image-edit API** with prompt+controls  
  - Stores results (S3/GCS) and returns signed URLs to app

- **Image Generation (Cloud)**  
  - Use Gemini/Nano-Banana **image edit** with the person image and the garment image(s)  
  - Enforce quality guardrails (size, file type, max queue, timeout)  
  - Expect **SynthID** watermark on outputs (acceptable for preview)

- **Storage & Auth**  
  - User assets in **S3/GCS** with short-lived signed URLs  
  - Auth via **Cognito/Firebase Auth/Clerk**; JWT forwarded to backend  
  - PII-light: Store only what is needed; allow user delete/export

- **Analytics & Observability**  
  - Event logging (screen views, success/failure, latency)  
  - Traces for `/tryon` pipeline and vendor API time

# API Contract (Draft)

## API Contract (Draft)

### `POST /tryon`
- **Headers:** `Authorization: Bearer <JWT>`
- **Body (multipart/form-data):**
  - `selfie`: binary image (`.jpg`/`.png`, ≤ 6 MB, max 4096x4096)
  - `item_urls`: JSON array of URLs (PDP or direct image). Backend should fetch images server-side.
  - `options` (optional): 
    ```json
    {
      "preserve_pose": true,
      "background": "keep",
      "garment_index": 0,
      "safety_mode": "strict",
      "return_mask": false
    }
    ```
- **Response 202:**
  ```json
  {"job_id": "uuid", "status": "queued"}
  ```

### `GET /job/{id}`
- **Response 200:**
  ```json
  {"status": "done", "result_url": "https://.../image.jpg", "latency_ms": 4280}
  ```
- **Errors:** `{"status":"failed","error_code":"VENDOR_TIMEOUT"}` etc.


# Image Edit Prompt Template

## Prompt Template (Vendor Image Edit)

**System / Instruction:**
> You are a professional fashion try-on compositor. Maintain the subject’s identity (face, hair, skin tone) and pose. Align garment scale and perspective naturally. Avoid artifacts on hands/necklines. Keep background intact.

**Inputs:**
- `PERSON_IMAGE`: the user selfie (frontal or 3/4th)
- `GARMENT_IMAGE`: primary product image with clear front view
- **Parameters:**
  - `keep_pose=true`
  - `lighting_match=medium`
  - `skin_tone_preserve=high`
  - `seam_blend=high`

**User Prompt (constructed by backend):**
“Place the garment from GARMENT_IMAGE onto the person in PERSON_IMAGE. Keep the person’s pose and hair visible, adjust garment drape naturally. Do not modify facial features. Output a single composited image suitable for app preview.”


# Security & Compliance

## Security, Privacy, and Compliance

- **User Consent:** Explicit consent for selfie processing and 3rd‑party AI calls.
- **PII Minimization:** Store only signed URLs and minimal metadata; allow deletion.
- **Content Policy:** Disallow nudity/CSAM/adversarial content; enforce **safe mode** with vendor.
- **Watermark Disclosure:** Generated images may include an **invisible watermark**; label UI as “AI Preview”.
- **Rate Limits:** Per-user throttle to prevent abuse; CAPTCHA on anonymous flows.


# SLOs & Operational Readiness

## Quality of Service & SLAs

- **Latency Targets:** p50 ≤ 5s, p95 ≤ 15s per try‑on.
- **Throughput:** Burst up to 50 concurrent jobs (queue + async workers).
- **Fallbacks:** If vendor fails, return last cached result or a friendly retry UI.


# Phased Roadmap

## Phased Roadmap

- **Phase 1 (MVP, 3–4 weeks)**
  - RN app with Selfie → URLs → Preview
  - Backend `/tryon` + vendor integration
  - Basic segmentation + caching + analytics

- **Phase 2 (Polish, 4–6 weeks)**
  - Multi-garment carousel, side-by-side compare
  - Pose guidance on capture, background cleanup
  - Share, delete, history; simple A/B quality tweaks

- **Phase 3 (Advanced, 6–8 weeks)**
  - Body/size estimation hints, fit feedback (heuristic)
  - Batch try-on for wishlists; vendor failover
  - Optional web companion

**Detected Roles/Owners:** _No items detected in spreadsheet; fill during grooming._

**Notes:**
- - Issue is breach of policy - for development purposes we may be able to build such extension, let's say, but we won't be able to publish them as we are scraping/using someone elses data on our server without their concent
- - How do you bring in previous selections i.e. before user started using the extension?
- - Breach of policy issue - FYI
- - So click photo and gather data manually? If yes, image quality will be a big fuss here 

[RD - 30th Oct]: Virtual image is second step, I'm saying the first image clicked by the person who wants to move their physical wardobe to digital - they need to click better image - that will be a huge problem if they don't click correct photo
- - Basic: possible
- - Need to read more about 2D/3D models and their rendering - this could be a high memory affair

| Third-party website access (extension)      | Extensions can’t override or alter Myntra, Zara, etc., DOMs in violation of CSP or TOS.     | Third-party site (host)         | Use content scripts to read only public PDP data (title, images, price). Inject a self-contained overlay (shadow-DOM) for “Try on Me”. Avoid touching site scripts. If CSP blocks image access, fetch images via backend proxy. |
| DOM or UI changes (A/B testing, redesign)   | Page layout or class names change, breaking selectors.                                      | Third-party site                | Maintain per-domain selector map and re-run detection via MutationObserver on DOM/URL changes. Add user fallback (“pick correct image”) and store rule per domain.                                                              |
